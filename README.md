<h1 align="center">Analyzing and Interpreting Boston's Airbnb Data: From Descriptive Statistics to Principal Component Analysis

### About Project üë®‚Äçüíª

- Dimensionality Reduction: Utilize Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to streamline the dataset by reducing the number of input variables, focusing on continuous variables for effective predictive modeling.
- Statistical Insights: Perform statistical analysis on continuous and categorical variables to uncover insights and identify anomalies, informing future modeling strategies.
- Correlation Analysis: Identify and address highly correlated variables through correlation analysis, ensuring a robust foundation for the predictive model by eliminating redundant information.

### Approach - Project Planning 
  
#### 1. Purpose: What? Why? What do we want to achieve?
- What? Analyze Airbnb listing data to reduce variable complexity through PCA and prepare for predictive modeling.
- Why? Understand market dynamics, improve data quality for modeling, and inform strategic decisions for hosts and Airbnb.
- Goal? Streamline the dataset, uncover market insights, lay the groundwork for accurate price prediction models, and drive strategic actions for improved listing performance and profitability.

#### 2. End Result: What do we want to achieve?
- The project aims to streamline the dataset for modeling, extract market insights, enable accurate price predictions, and guide strategic improvements for Airbnb listings in Boston.

### Setup Process

Step 1: Install Anaconda - Download the latest version of Anaconda for your operating system from the Anaconda website. Install Anaconda following the instructions provided, ensuring that you allow Anaconda to add itself to your system's PATH variable if prompted
  
Step 2: Launch Jupyter Notebook - Open Anaconda Navigator, a GUI for managing your Anaconda installation. Launch Jupyter Notebook from Anaconda Navigator. This will open a new tab in your default web browser with the Jupyter Notebook interface.
  
Step 3: Set Up Your Project Environment - Create a new Python environment for your project in Anaconda Navigator to manage dependencies efficiently. Activate the environment and open Jupyter Notebook within this environment for project isolation.

Step 4: Install Required Libraries - Ensure that essential libraries for data analysis and manipulation are installed, such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn, and others that might be relevant to your project.

Step 5: Import the dataset - Download csv file:(https://github.com/pwalve02/Analyzing-and-Interpreting-Boston-s-Airbnb-Data/blob/main/airbnb.csv)). Place the Airbnb CSV file in a directory accessible from your Jupyter Notebook. Use pandas to load the dataset: df = pd.read_csv('path/to/your/airbnb_dataset.csv').

Step 6:  Begin Your Analysis - Proceed with your analysis, statistical tests, PCA, and any other planned analyses.

Step 7: Document Your Findings
